                <p class="posts-p">&emsp; I found my cat sometime around September of 2022. He was an orange cat
                who was very frail and timid at first. He often came around our backyard looking for food, 
                so we started off feeding him rice, which he greatly appreciated. Three months would pass 
                and this would continue as usual.

                <p class="posts-p">&emsp; My family and I left for Galveston the last week of November for 
                Thanksgiving, not thinking anything of Taro, and upon our return home, he had suddenly became 
                very clingy. He would rub up on our legs when greeting us, and walk in between our legs when 
                going around the yard. Ever since, he has enjoyed being in our company as he enjoys watching
                and observing us as we do yard work, wash cars, or clean the garage. Something interesting I 
                find interesting about Taro is his way of communicating. What differs him from other cats is 
                that he doesn't <i>meow</i>. He instead talks to us by clicking and chriping, or by rubbing his 
                head on things he wants.
